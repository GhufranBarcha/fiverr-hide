# PrivacyLens Fiverr

## Overview

PrivacyLens Fiverr is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your privacy while using Fiverr. As you know fiverr doesn't have an inbuilt balance hider. Which could be pretty annoying when you want to share your fiverr account but don't want to show your earnings and client information or chat. This extension will help you hide that information with just a click.
